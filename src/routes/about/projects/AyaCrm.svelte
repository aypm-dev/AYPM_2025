			Well, it looks like the <b>C</b>ustomer <b>R</b>elationship <b>M</b>anagemer our company,
			Lionix, developed for AYA (the institution in charge of water supply infrastructure in Costa
			Rica) has outgrown its original scope over the years, thanks to the increasing traffic and
			user base.<br />

			Time for an upgrade! I was in charge right from the start. This enhancement requires code that
			stands the test of time with a cleaner and more modular approach. <br /><br />
		</p>

		<p class="hidden sm:block text-xl text-justify">
			And the modular part of the code was super important, because not only it was an update, but a
			whole template for future <b>CRM</b>s for a Call Center, business partner of Lionix :)

	"CRM App Base", and its job did! As of today, the base template was used in four projects, and
	hopefully even more in the future! One of these projects served as a showcase for a bank's
	upcoming card delivery system, set to cover the entire country. This really put the capabilities
	of the project to the test due to the short deadline of only 2 WEEKS!! (Lots of extra hours...)
	The project was later developed and put together into the final version in another 3-4 weeks.

<p class="sm:w-2/3 mx-auto mt-12 mb-24 text-xl text-justify">
	After a few months of solo development my good teammate joined the project and we managed to split
	the project perfectly so we could always have work to do.<br />
	I do appreciate his help, Without him the project would not be afloat on time.
