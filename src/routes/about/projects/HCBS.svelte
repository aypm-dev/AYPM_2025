	That's what Heroes Can Be Selfish is, a game I programmed, and published in only a month out of
	that inspiration!. This includes the code base, all artwork, game page, publicity, testing, and
	trailers!

	In every story the heroes are the embodyment of the selfless persona looking for the well-being of
	the people, saving them from mosters and returning back treasures from generations past... <br

	breed kiwis? And when no one in town suppects, their loose coins could be stolen out of their
	pockets by our kiwi... a broke and kleptomaniac kiwi addicted to purchasing useless items on
	Amezon to fill his home ;0
